# InstantPalgrave lite
Instant Palgrave, the open-source digital assistant for systems with little memory.


## Setup dev

Create a python3(.8??) virtualenv and then:

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and then:

```console
python3 palgrave.py
```

There are other bot modes you can run by specifying the bot implementation:

```console
python3 palgrave.py backwards
```

Supported implementations are `palgrave` (default, if you left blank), `echo`, `reverse`, and `backwards`.


## Trouble with pyaudio

In fedora I had to `dnf install portaudio-devel`. Ubuntu users might need `portaudio19-dev`

# Important!
Palgrave does not work with Windows yet - why? No idea, but just use Ubuntu / Fedora instead, it's easier
